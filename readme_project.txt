 Only ConnectFour must be run. Note: There is a "Click to Return"
 button at the top of the gameboard screen. Click this button at the
 end of the game to return to the menu. You will not be automatically
 returned to the main menu to allow you to examine the winner 
 announced at the top of the screen at your own leisure and then
 return to the menu when desired.
